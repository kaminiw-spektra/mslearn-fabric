   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   
   with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()

       model = LogisticRegression(C=1/0.1, solver="liblinear").fit(X_train, y_train)

       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "LogisticRegression")
    ```
    
    ![](./Images/E4T4S4.png)

1. Add a new code cell in the notebook using **+ Code (1)**. Then, in the new cell, add the following code **(2)** and click on the run cell icon **(3)**. This code trains a classification model using a Decision Tree Classifier. Parameters, metrics, and artifacts are automatically logged with MLflow. Additionally, you're logging a parameter called `estimator`, with the value `DecisionTreeClassifier`.

    ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   
   with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()

       model = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)
   
       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "DecisionTreeClassifier")
    ```

    >**Note:** If the node fails, attempt to re-run the previous node and then execute the existing node.

1.  Add a new code cell in the notebook using **+ Code**. Then, in the new cell, add the following code and click on the run cell icon. This code will more easily compare job runs and outputs. You can configure the search to order the results. For example, the following cell orders the results by `start_time`, and only shows a maximum of `2` results: 

    ```python
    mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)
    ```

1. Add a new code cell in the notebook using **+ Code**. Then, in the new cell, add the following code and click on the run cell icon. This code will finally plot the evaluation metrics of multiple models next to each other to easily compare models:

    ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   df_results = mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)[["metrics.training_accuracy_score", "params.estimator"]]
   
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   ax.bar(df_results["params.estimator"], df_results["metrics.training_accuracy_score"])
   ax.set_xlabel("Estimator")
   ax.set_ylabel("Accuracy")
   ax.set_title("Accuracy by Estimator")
   for i, v in enumerate(df_results["metrics.training_accuracy_score"]):
       ax.text(i, v, str(round(v, 2)), ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold')
   plt.show()
    ```
